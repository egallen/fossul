# General
Fossil is a container-native backup framework. It aims to provide an application consistent backup in the container-driven world using various plugins. Any application or storage system can be integrated. The plugin framework aims to support any programming language, even shell script.
We believe the backup process can be standardized and democratized using a dynamic plugin-driven workflow. Welcome to Fossil where you can save your applications state forever.
